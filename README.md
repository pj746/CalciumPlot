# CalciumPlot
This is the repo of my work while working in the Lab of Dr. Ying Li at CIBR. It was used to study the social interaction of mice. The code can plot the Calcium imaging data that aligns with behaviors and ultrasounds. The finding was published on [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abl4038).

Special thanks:
